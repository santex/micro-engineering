{"cursor":"11643","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn mechanical engineering, 'backlash' is the striking back of connected wheels\nin a piece of mechanism when pressure is applied. Another source defines it as\nthe maximum distance through which one part of something can be moved without\nmoving a connected\npart. [http://www.mechanicalengineeringblog.com/tag/backlash/Mechanical\nEngineering - A Complete Online Guide for Every Mechanical Engineer] In\nthe context of gears backlash, sometimes called 'lash' or 'play', is clearance\nbetween mating components, or the amount of lost motion due to clearance or\nslackness when movement is reversed and contact is re-established. For example,\nin a pair of gears backlash is the amount of clearance between mated gear teeth.\n\nTheoretically, the backlash should be zero, but in actual practice some backlash\nmust be allowed to prevent jamming. It is unavoidable for nearly all reversing\nmechanical couplings, although its effects can be negated. Depending on the\napplication it may or may not be desirable. Reasons for requiring backlash\ninclude allowing for lubrication, manufacturing errors, deflection under load\nand thermal expansion.\n","linknr":179,"url":"Backlash_(engineering)","recorded":1362482955,"links":23,"instances":["device","electronics","length","engineering"],"pdf":["http://www.qtcgears.com/Q410/PDF/techsec14.pdf"],"categories":["Gears","Screws"],"headings":["Gears","Minimum backlash","Applications","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Backlash.svg/220px-Backlash.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/f/3/ef380eca52ed9e3e2c8a26104ea03bbe.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/9/3/d93fad2174c4db95670d1f0f6f7ca56f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/e/c/0ec0ee30f54bf54a3ffcdce35f42b55a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/b/a/2baab7ae11429bb4ec85b5cdf3f4a6e9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/b/3/4b313a6388b6c87932107d7576a9010c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/b/c/2bc7804a46386d8c4a93bd921e193f91.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/3/e/33ed74643b534995ef330ac42c9f0f58.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/a/f/9affcab55e4aa002efc90e45fe664b99.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["deflection","engineering"],["tuner","electronics"],["spring","device"],["thou","length"]],"members":["spring","tuner","thou","deflection"],"related":["Mechanical_engineering","Gear","Lubrication","Deflection_(engineering)","Thermal_expansion","Runout","Pitch_circle","Pressure_angle","Pinion","Diametral_pitch","Gear_train","Radio","Tuner_(electronics)","Spring_(device)","Leadscrew","Screw_thread","Machine_tool","Bearing_surface","Trapezoidal_thread_forms","Numerical_control","Thou_(length)","Ball_screw","Duplex_worm","Frontlash_gearbox","Control_theory","Oscillation","Gear_coupling","Ball_screw","Leadscrew","Dog_clutch","List_of_gear_nomenclature","Harmonic_drive"]}
