{"cursor":"8217","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn engineering, 'redundancy' is the duplication of critical s or functions of a\nsystem with the intention of increasing reliability of the system, usually in\nthe case of a backup or fail-safe.\n\nIn many safety-critical systems, such as fly-by-wire and hydraulic systems in\naircraft, some parts of the control system may be triplicated, which is formally\ntermed triple modular redundancy (TMR). An error in one component may then be\nout-voted by the other two. In a triply redundant system, the system has three\nsub components, all three of which must fail before the system fails. Since each\none rarely fails, and the sub components are expected to fail independently, the\nprobability of all three failing is calculated to be extraordinarily small;\noften outweighed by other risk factors, e.g., human error. Redundancy may also\nbe known by the terms \"'majority voting systems'\" or \"'voting logic'\". numerous\ncables are a form of redundancy.]]\n","linknr":161,"url":"Redundancy_(engineering)","recorded":1362483275,"links":24,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/201/ibmrd2001E.pdf","http://www.yamar.com/The-Vehicle-Power-Line-as-a-Redundant-Channel-fo-CAN-Communication.pdf"],"categories":["Engineering concepts","Reliability engineering","Safety","Fault tolerance","Fault-tolerant computer systems"],"headings":["Forms of redundancy","Function of redundancy","Voting logic","Calculating the probability of system failure","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/PC-Netzteil_%28redundant%29.jpg/220px-PC-Netzteil_%28redundant%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Reliability_block_diagram.png/220px-Reliability_block_diagram.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Bridge-suspension.svg/220px-Bridge-suspension.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/7/3/073b46844d8fbcd4e10382f495e76260.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/8/7b8b965ad4bca0e41ab51de7b31363a1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/0/2/102ce91efd71f298feb317606f63a190.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/3/8/83878c91171338902e0fe0fb97a8c47a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/f/8/6f8f57715090da2632453988d9a1501b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/8/7b8b965ad4bca0e41ab51de7b31363a1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/2/e/12e8c4d2036eba138e53258cd519440d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/3/8/83878c91171338902e0fe0fb97a8c47a.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["degeneracy","biology"]],"members":["degeneracy"],"related":["Engineering","System","Fail-safe","Safety-critical_system","Fly-by-wire","Hydraulic","Aircraft","Triple_modular_redundancy","Dual_modular_redundant","Triple_modular_redundancy","Error_detection_and_correction","N-version_programming","Active_redundancy","Active_redundancy","Active_redundancy","Power_scheduling","Space_shuttle","Degeneracy_(biology)","Common_mode_failure","Data_redundancy","Double_switching","Fault-tolerant_design","Radiation_hardening","Factor_of_safety","Reliability_engineering","Reliability_theory_of_aging_and_longevity","Safety_engineering","Self-healing_ring","MTBF"]}
