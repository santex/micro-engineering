{"cursor":"2281","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The colloquial term 'nines' is used in engineering to indicate reliability or\npurity (or similar quantitative descriptor). It is preceded by a number\nindicating the degree of such reliability or purity. For example, 0.999 (or 99.9\npercent) pure silver would be 3 nines pure. Or, for example, electricity that is\ndelivered without interruptions (blackouts, brownouts or surges) 99.999 percent\nof the time would have 5 nines reliability. Reliability can be considered a time-\nbased purity. Also related are the topics of defect rates, Parts-per notation,\nMTBF and MTTR.\n\nIn mathematical terms, the quantity of nines is equal to the negative common\nlogarithm of one minus the actual number, i.e.\n−log 10 (1−n).\n","linknr":94,"url":"Nines_(engineering)","recorded":1362486327,"links":13,"instances":["electricity"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Measurement"],"headings":["Table of values","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Nuvola_apps_kfig.svg/30px-Nuvola_apps_kfig.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["brownout","electricity"]],"members":["brownout"],"related":["Reliability_engineering","Power_outage","Brownout_(electricity)","Voltage_spike","Parts-per_notation","MTBF","Mean_time_to_recovery","Common_logarithm","Day","Hour","Minute","Second","Millisecond","Microsecond","Class_of_9s","Uptime","High_availability","0.999..."]}
